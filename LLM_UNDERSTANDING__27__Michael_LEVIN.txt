 I don't... Is your background also in computer science or just in biology and psychology?
 No, computer science first, then biology.
 Okay, all the more so. Michael is the director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University,
 which is also Dan Dennett's former institution. His lab works at the intersection of developmental
 biology, artificial life, bioengineering, synthetic morphology, and cognitive science.
 Seeking general principles of life as it can be, we use... We, that's they. I'm reading their
 statement. They use a wide range of natural animal models and also create novel synthetic
 and chimeric life forms. Their goal is to develop generative conceptual frameworks that help
 detect, understand, predict, and communicate with truly diverse intelligences,
 including cells, tissues, organs, synthetic living constructs, robots, and software-based
 AIs. Their applications range from biomedical intervention, interventions to new ethical roadmaps.
 Welcome to Montreal, Mike, and it's all yours.
 Thank you so much. And thank you for having me at this amazing gathering. It's a real privilege
 to be able to share some ideas with you all. If anybody's interested in the primary papers,
 the datasets, the software, everything is at this site here. Okay, so there's a few things that I
 would like to say today. I'm going to just kind of give you an overview right up front. I'm going to
 talk about this multi-scale competency architecture, which underlies most of biology, and in particular,
 some very interesting physiological software that is operating on this genetically defined hardware.
 We're going to talk about some concepts, including the cognitive light cone or the
 size of the largest goal that a system can pursue. We'll talk a little bit about
 polycomputing or this idea that the same biological processes are interpreted by
 different subsystems as very different computations. I'm going to go in some detail
 into an example of an unconventional basal intelligence, basically collectives of cells
 that expertly navigate anatomical space and solve all sorts of problems. This has many
 implications for biomedicine and bioengineering. Towards the end, I'll talk about the idea that
 the synthetic morphoengineering advances provide really an enormous option space for new bodies
 and new minds that do not have standard evolutionary backstories. So this really offers
 us an opportunity to think about evolution, biomedicine, robotics, and ethics in new ways.
 And we in my group focus on emergent cognition, not just emergent complexity. So the bottom
 line to all of this is that biology definitely does things very differently than today's
 AIs and robotics, but I don't think it's specifically because of brains. I think it's
 way older than that, and I don't think there's any particular reason that we cannot make use
 of these same properties in our artificial constructs. So this is an old engraving. This
 is Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden. And something like this underlies a lot of
 discussions in this field, even if not consciously acknowledged. There are two things represented
 here, one that I think is deeply wrong and one that is actually quite profound, and it's going
 to matter a lot to us. The thing that I think needs to change is this idea that all of these
 are natural kinds, that there are discrete kinds of animals that are very unique, specific things.
 And this Adam here is the most unique of them all. And we can talk about human intelligence
 as a specific demarcated thing. The thing that I think they got quite right is that in this story,
 it was on Adam to name the animals in the Garden of Eden. Now, this is interesting because according
 to these ancient traditions, naming something means that you've discovered its true inner nature.
 And I think as you'll see by the end of the talk, I think it will be on us to name a whole wide range
 of novel beings that are going to be living with us and to understand their nature and to be able
 to live with them in a kind of symbiosis. So the first thing we can tell from work of really
 classical scientists well over a hundred years ago is that this idea of a human, a normal human,
 which features prominently in discussions of philosophy and AI and so on, is really at a
 certain point in a very smooth continuum. So both on an evolutionary level and at a developmental
 level, all of us evolved from single cells and we developed from single cells. And so when you make
 claims about what humans do or do not do, we have to ask ourselves where in this continuum those
 capacities emerge, how do they scale, those kinds of things. Even more complex is the fact that we
 now know that at every level of organization, we can introduce novel, either biological or designed
 material, which means that there's also a continuum this way of technologically modified or
 biologically modified beings. So whatever it is that we're saying about humans in terms of their
 capacities, their moral responsibilities, and all of those kinds of things, we need to ask how far
 away with really quite small steps you can go along all of these different continua and how do
 those things change as you do that. So the framework that I'm working on has as a goal this
 aspiration to help us recognize, create, and relate to, ethically relate to, truly diverse
 intelligences, regardless of what they're made of or how they got here. And so of course this means
 familiar types of biologicals, apes and birds, and maybe an octopus or something like that,
 but also some very unusual creatures. This means colonial organisms and swarms, engineered new life
 forms, AIs, whether purely software or some sort of robotic, and potentially at some point even
 exobiological agents. And the criteria for this framework is that it cannot be just philosophy.
 It has to move experimental work forward. It has to these kinds of perspectives that I'm going to
 talk about today have to, the acid test is do they help us make new discoveries? And I'm going to
 argue that they do. They actually lead to novel research programs. Of course, I'm not the first
 person to try for something like this. So here's Wiener and colleagues back in 1943 that was trying
 to understand what the scaling of relationships are like all the way from passive matter up to
 the kind of complex metacognitive properties that we have. And the details of all of this are in
 this paper if you're interested. So one way to think about different kinds of systems, really
 diverse kinds of systems, is to adopt an engineering approach and simply ask what are the tools in our
 toolkit to optimally interact with each kind of system. So at one end you have simple machines
 where hardware modification is the only game in town. Then you have these sort of cybernetic kinds
 of things like homeostats where you can actually change the set point and rely on the system to do
 some work to hold on to it. Then of course we have systems that have different kinds of learning
 and memory and then all the way up here and whatever's beyond that. So one of the things
 that I think is true about these kind of continuum models is that first of all they take all cognitive
 claims to be protocols, communication and relationship protocols, as opposed to statements
 about the system itself. What you're saying is how you plan to interact with that system.
 That's I think what you're really saying when you say that a system is somewhere on this continuum
 and then what's good about that is that it's an empirical claim. So you can try it, see how that
 works out and somebody else who thinks the system should be at a different position gets to try their
 bag of tools and see what happens. So we use this approach to ask for example where do groups of
 cells in your body, where do they fit in and the current assumption of let's say molecular biology
 is that they're here maybe, maybe edging into this but I actually think that's wrong and
 we do experiments to try to sort that out. Now in this audience I don't need to introduce
 Alan Turing to anybody but what's really interesting about what he was doing when
 he was interested in problem solving machines and intelligence through reprogrammability
 is that he also wrote a paper. This is one of the earliest papers of modeling the processes
 of embryonic development on how order arises in the chemistry of early embryogenesis. Now you might
 wonder why would somebody who was interested in mind and intelligence and computation and things
 like that, why would he be interested in what's happening with chemicals during development?
 And I think although he didn't write much about this but I really think that he had, he was onto
 a profound truth which is that the origin of minds and the origin of bodies are fundamentally very
 symmetrical processes. So what I'd like to do in the next few minutes is to take you through a tour
 of some of unique features of the biological substrate. There are some very interesting
 things about biological materials and their capabilities that I think shed light on this
 process of origination of and scaling of minds and what it means for understanding and for AIs in
 general. So the first fact about biology is that it really makes this journey so all of us were once
 a quiescent oocyte, an unfertilized oocyte, a little blob of chemicals and slowly, very gradually
 over a lengthy time period, it's self-assembled into one of these remarkable functional anatomies
 or maybe something like this that's then going to make claims that you know it's not a machine and
 it's different from what the laws of physics allow. But this is the journey that each of
 us undertook and so we have to understand what's happening here, what exactly is going on when the
 mind arises from this kind of humble beginning. Now another thing that we might think is that okay
 so we arise from a single cell, clearly the kind of processes of chemistry and physics are our origin,
 but at least we have a centralized unified intelligence. We have a brain, we have a solid
 brain, not like ant colonies or swarms of bees which some people in the Ricard Soleil calls them
 liquid brains, but you know a lot of people think that's just a metaphor but we actually have a
 nice unified centralized brain and in fact Descartes was really into the pineal gland because there's
 only one of them in the brain and it was tempting to think that our unified experience is in some
 way responsible, is related to this singular structure. But of course if he had access to
 good microscopy what he would see is that there actually isn't one of anything because inside the
 pineal gland are all these cells and inside of those each of those cells is all of this stuff.
 So in an important sense we are all collective intelligences, we are all made of parts and the
 interesting story here is how those parts give rise to higher order cells. So this is the sort
 of thing, this is a typical building block, now this happens to be a free living organism
 called the lacrimaria, a single cell, no brain, no nervous system, no stem cells, just a single cell,
 very competent in its local tiny little sphere of influence aka its cognitive light cone is quite
 small, the goals that it pursues are very small. Now what's remarkable about the biological
 material is that it can individuate higher order cells from large collections of cells. So let's
 see how that works out. So here are embryonic cells of a human, let's say a human for example,
 embryonic blastoderm, there's maybe let's say 50,000 cells at this point and that's a flat sheet,
 we look at this and we say okay there's an embryo and we know what it becomes, it becomes one human
 with a human mind. Now what is it that allows us to look at 50,000 cells and say that's one of
 anything, what makes it one embryo? Well what makes it one embryo is literally alignment, both
 physical alignment and functional alignment, all of these cells are connected, they're all going to
 align via planar polarity and they are they have all adopted the same picture of where they are
 going to go in anatomical morpheus space, meaning they are all going to work together to build
 exactly one structure, they are all aligned with respect to their anatomical goals, they are all
 going to do one thing. Now what you can do is you can take a little needle and I used to do this
 as a graduate student in duck embryos, you take a little needle and you can make scratches in this
 blastoderm and what will happen then is that until for the next let's say four to six hours until
 these scratches heal, each one of these little islands does not feel the presence of the others,
 it self-organizes into its own embryo, it is aligned within itself but not with these others
 and when they finally heal up what you end up with is multiple embryos in the same blastoderm, so this
 is how naturally this is how twins triplets and so on arise. So what's happening here is that
 then each one of these embryos has to demarcate itself from the outside world, they have to ask
 where do I end and the other self or the outside world begins because every cell is some other
 cell's neighbor, so establishing borders is critical and this kind of splitting, this
 fragmentation has all sorts of interesting relationships to things that we see in cognitive
 science in terms of dissociative identity disorders, split brain and so on. There's
 something else here which is that having seen this blastoderm you cannot say how many
 individuals there are because that number is not fixed by the genetics, it could be zero, one, two,
 three, probably up to half a dozen, the number of cognitive cells that come from this individual
 from this blastoderm is not fixed in advance, they self-organize in real time. Okay another important
 thing about the biological substrate is that it really does not overtrain on its evolutionary
 priors, it is very flexible and willing to do new things, so for example here is a tadpole, there's
 the mouth, the nostrils, the brain, the tail, for millions of years this creature has evolved
 to be successful with two eyes here connected to the brain. What you'll notice here is that we've
 prevented the primary eyes from forming but we've induced an eye on its tail, I'll talk about more
 about how we do those things. So it turns out that this animal can see perfectly well right out of
 the box, we made this machine, it's an automated training and testing tool that trains them in
 visual assays. These eyes do put out an optic nerve, that optic nerve does not connect to the brain,
 it connects to the spinal cord, to the gut or sometimes nowhere and despite that these animals
 perform very well in visual assays. So you don't need new rounds of evolutionary adaptation,
 it self-assembles a functional form and the behavior is you know is adapts to this new
 architecture of this sensor motor system. It also, the biological substrate also enables
 information to move across the media in really interesting ways. For example, here's a flatworm,
 you'll hear more about this in a bit but one of the things about them is that they regenerate,
 so you can cut them into pieces and every piece gives rise to a perfect little worm.
 So what happens is that if you train them and they have a true centralized brain and most of
 the same neurotransmitters that we have, if you train them in a place conditioning task to recognize
 a particular area where they will look for food, you can then cut off their head, leave the tail,
 it does nothing for about eight to eight or nine days until it grows back a new head and then
 behavior resumes and then you find that they remember the original information. So what's
 happening here is that presumably the information is stored elsewhere in the body but then it's
 imprinted onto the new brain as the brain develops. So you can see here a crossover between the
 morphological memory that leads them to rebuild the correct structure but also the behavioral
 memories that can be stored outside the brain and then re-imprinted onto the new central controller
 here. There's an important aspect to this which is that that information is not merely stored in
 the sense of kept, you know, sort of kept intact but it's actually remapped and so let's consider
 this kind of system. You've got a caterpillar. The caterpillar has a particular brain suitable
 for navigating a two-dimensional world and eating leaves. It has to turn into this. This is a soft
 body kind of creature. This is a hard-bodied creature, flies in the three-dimensional world,
 drinks nectar, completely different controller needed for that and so what it does in the
 meantime is basically liquefy its brain. Lots of the cells are killed off, most of the connections
 are broken and yet what's been shown is that these moths or butterflies remember the original
 information but what's interesting here is that the exact memories of the caterpillar, meaning crawl
 in a particular way for a particular stimulus to get leaves, are of no use to the butterfly at all.
 Butterfly does not crawl. It doesn't care for leaves so what has to happen is that this
 information has to be remapped to make sense in a completely new body architecture in a new environment
 and so one way to think about this is that biology does not emphasize fidelity of the
 information. What it emphasizes is saliency. In other words, if you think about memories, even our
 own memories, as a kind of message from our past self, the idea is that those messages, like any
 message, have to be interpreted. The compressed engrams of past experience have to be interpreted
 by our future selves in whatever way is most appropriate to the context. I think biology
 fundamentally assumes that the hardware is unreliable both in a developmental context and
 evolutionarily. Not just the environment will change but your body will change. You will
 mutate. Everything is going to change and this is why these kinds of things like the tadpoles
 with the eyes on their tails and some other things I'm going to show you, this is why they work
 because out of the box the system does not assume that it can take the information literally. It has
 to do a construction project that is going to use the past memories in whatever way it can but
 reinterpret them as it has to. All of that is described here. Another important thing
 for these kind of discussions of AI and so on has to do with embodiment. It is often said that
 what you really need for true cognition is some kind of body that's going to act in space and
 that you can learn from that but actually biology uses all kinds of spaces that are different from
 the three-dimensional space that is so obvious to us. We're reasonably good at recognizing
 intelligence in familiar three-dimensional space but that's mostly because we're so used to it and
 all of our sense organs point outwards and we kind of recognize medium-sized objects moving
 at medium speeds as typical intelligences but biology operates in many other spaces. So they
 saw a living thing solve problems in the high-dimensional space of gene expression,
 in the space of physiological states and what we're going to talk about today mostly is anatomical
 morphous space. So there are these other spaces that are not visible to us except through
 experiments. They are not easy for us to sort of visualize and reason about but perception
 action loops can absolutely happen in all of these other spaces. So just because something doesn't
 have a body in the conventional sense of some sort of robot that drives around the physical world
 does not mean that a system is not doing all of these kinds of things that are necessary for
 cognition in some other space. In fact I would argue that what evolution has done and I'm going
 to show you kind of this middle example here is pivot some of the same navigational strategies
 across spaces so first metabolic space and then physiological space and eventually genes came on
 the scene and there was transcriptional space and then multicellularity and you had anatomical space
 and eventually brains and muscles showed up and now three-dimensional behavioral space even
 navigating linguistic space. So what we have then in biology is this multi-scale architecture but
 it's not just a set of nested dolls structurally it is the fact that each of these levels solves
 problems. They have their own competencies in different spaces and they use some of the same
 tricks actually but at different levels of sophistication and so what I'd like to do now
 is to talk about one kind of deep dive into one case study which is the collective intelligence
 of cells and how they solve problems in anatomical space and so just to kind of back up again into
 the big picture what we're looking at here is an unconventional intelligence
 that we are going to try to use some of the same tools of behavior science of neuroscience and so
 on to understand how we can use those tools to give us greater prediction and control over a
 system that is doing some very interesting problem solving. I'm going to show you some
 biomedicine that was discovered by attempts to communicate with this intelligence through its
 preferred interface and I think this has real applications because in the sense it takes
 neuroscience well beyond neurons and we can use this to try to push AI beyond really kind of
 neuromorphic architectures that seek to mimic the brain so this is an example so this isn't AI or
 Photoshop this is a real insect this is a this is a fly it has this kind of it's sort of running a
 very low resolution stripped down two-dimensional morphogenetic program of some ants on its wings
 the goal is to deter predators so it sort of does this little dance where it waves the wings around
 and looks like ants are scurrying around and so that's pretty remarkable but it's not as remarkable
 as the formation of the actual fly itself where did this complex structure come from so this is
 a human torso this is the cross section through a human torso you can see the amazing border here
 all the structures of the right shape the right size relative to the right thing and so on
 but we we start life as a collection of embryonic blastomeres so where is this pattern actually
 encoded how do the cells know to do this and people are tempted to say DNA but as we've known for a
 long time and especially now that we can actually read genomes the DNA doesn't directly specify any
 of this the DNA specifies proteins and the tiny molecular level hardware that every cell gets to
 have all of this meaning knowing what to build knowing when to stop is a is a consequence of
 that that hardware playing out physiological kinds of activities and we need to know as workers in
 regenerative medicine we need to know how to induce cells to rebuild it if there's damage
 and as engineers we have a further question which is what else could they build how much
 plasticity is there here like what could what else could we get perfectly normal
 genetically normal cells to to build and the end game of that of that effort I view as something
 I call the anatomical compiler so the idea is that someday you will be able to sit down
 in front of in front of this machine and draw that plant or animal or organ or biobot or whatever it
 is draw at the level of anatomy not the molecular biology but the anatomy and then what the system
 would do is compile that description down into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to
 specific cells to get them to build whatever it is that you want them to build now on a practical
 level the reason this would be nice is that birth defects traumatic injury cancer aging degenerative
 disease all of these things would go away if we knew how to communicate our goals to a set of cells
 and get them to build what we want them to build and of course keep in mind this is the idea here
 this is this is not a 3d printer the idea is not to micromanage the construction of these things
 it's a communications device it's fundamentally to communicate your goals as the as the bioengineer
 to the collective that then has what i'm going to show you momentarily which is a kind of
 homeostatic set point now the thing is we don't have yet anything remotely close to that molecular
 biology is is now very good at this kind of information which molecules and genes control
 which others were very far away from control of large-scale form and function and i think
 that's because currently most most let's say molecular medicine has been stuck at this stage
 where everything is at the hardware level so genomic editing protein engineering pathway
 rewiring all the exciting advances have been at the level of the hardware what we've barely touched
 really is the the most important and exciting thing about biology which is the the reprogram ability
 and the intelligence of the material that we're dealing with now when i say intelligence what do
 i mean i like william james's definition which is a nice substrate independent kind of definition
 which says it's the it's it's some degree of the ability to reach the same goal by different means
 and he talks about the limitation of barrier of of magnets not being able to go around the barrier
 because they they're not smart enough to go against temporarily go against that gradient all the way
 up to you know romeo and julia separated by all kinds of barriers that they have a complex
 cognitive skills to to try to get around so now we can ask this question okay so so on this continuum
 and given this this this amazing biological material that has a problem solving at multiple
 scales lots of plasticity what what what kind of intelligence does it have what problems can it
 actually deploy well the first thing we notice is that while development is very reliable so
 so almost all eggs end up the correct the correct anatomical shape it is actually not hardwired
 because what you can do with embryos of many species including humans is cut them into pieces
 and you don't get half bodies what you get are monozygotic perfectly normal twins triplets and
 so on and so that means that they can navigate this anatomical space from different starting
 positions to the same ensemble of goal states corresponding to the normal human target morphology
 they can avoid various local maxima along the way there are many examples that we could talk about
 if we had more time but the point is the process is not not hardwired in a few species actually
 it seems to be but but the vast majority of animals are not like that it it has this ability
 to get to where it's going and that in some animals does not stop at the embryonic stage
 this is a an axolotl and this amphibian regenerates its limbs its eyes its jaws its heart
 portions of the brain spinal cord and so on and what's amazing is that if you cut the limb at any
 point along this axis the cells rapidly spring into action they build exactly what's needed
 no more no less and then they stop that's kind of the most amazing thing about all of this is that
 they know when to stop when do they stop they stop when a correct salamander arm has been completed
 that is the the the this the set point that that that they reach and then activity ceases now by
 the way amphibians are not the only ones who do something like this other creatures can do it too
 we are sort of not great at it we regenerate our liver human children regenerate their fingertips
 and deer regenerate huge amounts of bone vasculature innervation every year so they you
 know we can we can do a little bit of but but it's it's it's that ability to restore what you have to
 get back to that same location an anatomical space despite unexpected perturbations being
 dragged into a region of that space that you did not expect is not is not the end of it there's
 something even more interesting so this is this is one of my favorite examples so what you have here
 is a the lumen of a of a kidney tubule in in newt and usually there's about eight to ten cells that
 get together and they form this little this little tube so one trick you can do in these in these
 animals is to make the cells much larger by increasing the copy number of their genetic
 material if you increase the genetic material the cells get bigger the first amazing thing is that
 you still get a normal newt out of it even even though they have multiple copies of the genome
 but what you see is that fewer cells are now getting together to build this exact same structure
 what you can even do is and so the second amazing thing is that they can they scale the number of
 cells due to the novel cell size what you can do is make a 6n polyploid newts which have huge cells
 and what these cells do there's not even enough room for two cells here so what they'll do is
 they'll wrap around themselves and still get you the same final structure using a different
 molecular mechanism this is cell to cell communication and tubulogenesis this is some
 kind of cytoskeletal bending so in the service of a of an of an anatomical goal that they're trying
 to make they can call up different tools in their in their toolkit different molecular processes
 to get to the same region so this is just just imagine what it means if you're if you're a newt
 coming into the world you can't you you can't depend on how much genetic material you're going
 to have you can't know what the size of your cells are going to be you don't know what the
 number of your cells are going to be you have to be able to finish that journey in morphospace in
 very novel circumstances i think biology and specifically evolution assumes from the get-go
 that we cannot count on any of this and so what it's done is really produce algorithms that are
 able to complete the complete these journeys even when things change not just the environment
 changes but actually the internal parts change and that competency that ability to fix problems and
 get to where you need to go even if your starting material is different produces what i think is a
 real intelligence ratchet because it hides information from selection and it forces evolution to
 do most of the work on the competency mechanism instead of the structural genome and you end up
 with species like planaria that are immortal cancer resistant highly regenerative and have an
 incredibly chaotic genome for reasons that we can discuss in the q a and so the final example that
 i want to show you before i tell you how all this works is uh this this uh example of um
 of navigation that has to do with changing from a tadpole to a frog so normally here's the here's
 the tadpole they have to rearrange their face to become a normal frog and so all the organs have to
 move and typically it was it was thought that this is a hardwired process every organ just goes
 you know in the right direction the right amount and and it works so we decided to test that and
 we made these so-called picasso tadpoles so everything is in the wrong place the eyes on
 the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything is scrambled and these animals still
 become quite normal frogs because the genetics does not specify a set of hardwired movements
 what it actually specifies is an error minimization scheme it specifies a system that can start off
 in the wrong position all of these organs will move in novel in fact abnormal paths sometimes
 they go too far and they have to come back and eventually it settles down into a correct frog
 face so um what we're what we're thinking here is that in addition to the standard story of uh of
 of cell biology which is that uh this is a there's a kind of this this open loop emergence so
 complexity and emergence comes from lots of uh so lots of local rules being being executed sort of
 like a cellular automaton actually uh that's true and that does happen but that's not the only thing
 that happens there are these feedback loops which if you are deviated from your target morphology
 there are these feedback loops that try to reduce the error so this is fundamentally a homeostatic
 circuit that tries to get back to where you need to be if you're deviated by mutation by
 injury by teratogens and so on and so this uh this raises some obvious questions for example
 where is the set point stored how does the system know what the set point is every the homeostatic
 system should have a set point where is that set point stored and of course uh this is this is a
 pretty unusual um thing for for biology because of course you know we know all about set points for
 ph for for for temperature for the hunger things like that but here what you have as a set point
 is actually a pretty complex not a single number it's not a scalar it's a a complex representation
 of the anatomy that has to serve as the target state for this uh for this process so so that
 ability to to reduce error to reach your target morphology to navigate that anatomical space
 is the intelligence that we're talking about here and as I've shown you can what it what it's able
 to do is to use different underlying mechanisms to get its goals met so uh so so we now a couple
 decades ago started the search for where is the the memory for all of this and we took our
 inspiration from neuroscience where we have the kind of uncontroversial example of a set of cells
 that store a memory that guides future behavior right so so the goal directedness
 we we know what this looks like in the brain so here's the cellular hardware the the network
 of cells with ion channels that create voltage states that may or may not be propagated to their
 neighbors and then the physiological signal processing that happens here is according
 to the commitment of neuroscience is the the medium in which the memories the goals the
 preferences the capabilities of that creature are encoded everything is in the electrophysiology
 of the system and then the sort of neural decoding project is this idea that if we could read it and
 so here's a zebrafish brain in a living fish if we could read this information and decode it we would
 know the cognitive content of this mind we would know what the animal was thinking what it remembers
 and so on well it turns out that this architecture it's very powerful and it was invented long before
 brains or even neurons came on the scene this is uh this is ancient about the time of bacterial
 biofilms is when evolution first discovered that these electrical circuits are really good for
 storing information for making decisions for integrating information across distance and also
 across time every cell in your body has these ion channels most cells have electrical synapses
 connecting them into a network and what we started to do was basically the same thing this idea of
 decoding these bioelectrical states to try to understand what does the what what what do what
 do the networks of the body think about we know what the networks in your brain think about they
 think about moving you through three-dimensional space it turns out that long before that what
 what they were used for these electrical networks were used for to move the configuration of your
 body through anatomical space a very similar kinds of tricks projected into a different space so we
 developed the first tools to read and write this information in and out of tissues so we use voltage
 sensitive fluorescent dyes you can see that here in in cells the colors represent voltages these are
 not models these are real these are real data this is an early frog embryo as the cell is cells are
 trying to figure out what shape are we making how many eyes who's left who's right that kind of thing
 and then of course we do a lot of computational simulations both biorealistic ones where we try
 to understand the where the voltage patterns come from and then things like pattern completion
 and what happens when part of the part of the pattern is actually gone how does the collective
 reset it i want to show you a couple of examples here's a time lapse of a frog embryo putting its
 face together and what you will see here is one particular snapshot out of this voltage imaging
 where what you can see long before the genes turn on to regionalize the face you see here's the
 memory of what a correct face is supposed to look like here's where the eye is going to be here's
 the mouth here the placodes these cells already have a pretty good idea of where everything goes
 and not only do the individual cells communicate via this pattern but actually individual embryos
 you can see here this this wave passing between embryos and here you can see the different the
 different cells uh kind of sorting out what they're going to do uh these are these are the kind of uh
 you this is analogous to brain imaging this is we're actually seeing the electrophysiology that
 that is responsible for the anatomical problem solving that you saw before now how do we know
 that this is functionally instructive well we develop tools to actually now read and
 to actually write modified electrical information back into the cells now we do not use any kind of
 electric fields there are no waves no frequencies no magnets no applied electromagnetic radiation
 what we do is basically take advantage of the interface that the cells are using to hack each
 other cells tell each other what to do via electrical signals through their gap junctions
 and through these ion channels and that is the communication interface we exploit by putting in
 and taking out various channels by optogenetics which is using light to turn these ion conductances
 on and off okay so what what can you do if you start if you start manipulating this bioelectrical
 information well one thing you can do is you can activate very high level anatomical subroutines
 so we take some RNA that encodes a particular potassium channel we inject it into cells that
 are normally going to be this gut here and what that ends up doing is saying to these cells build
 an eye right here and that is what they do they build these eyes the eyes have normal lens retina
 optic nerve these kind of these kind of things what we do not do is provide all the information
 about how to build an eye we are not micromanaging this process we do not directly control the gene
 expression we are not talking to stem cells we expect the material to know how to build an eye
 and what we are providing is a stimulus that gets it to to do that now as it does that it has many
 other competencies for example if we only target a few of the cells so this is a cross section
 through that through one of those eyes if we target only a few of those cells what they do so
 the blue cells are the ones that we targeted all of this other stuff that's participating that was
 they induce their neighbors to help okay so so that's a secondary instruction that we do not
 have to teach them how to do this and we say build an eye they can tell there's not enough of them
 to build a proper eye and they recruit their neighbors the way that other collective intelligences
 scale their numbers to appropriate tasks this has obvious kind of regenerative medicine application
 so so we've done this kind of thing in for regeneration of limbs so frogs unlike salamanders
 do not regenerate their limbs but so that's what normally happens but if you use voltage modulation
 to tell these cells that hey you should go down the the leg building route instead of the scarring
 route then you can trigger within 45 days you've already got some toes you've got a toenail
 eventually a touch sensitive and motile leg that's a pretty good pretty good anatomy
 you can get a year and a half of leg growth after just 24 hours of bioelectrical communication with
 those limb cells after you do it you don't need to touch them again the system takes off and takes
 care of the rest and I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have a company
 that is going to try to push this into into human you know human bioengineering but but the idea
 and try to try to regenerate limbs and human patients eventually hopefully but the idea here
 is that asking these kinds of questions about what is the material capable of what is the causal
 architecture what are the subroutines that we can that we can access leads to all kinds of new
 discoveries it leads to a pre-clinical work hopefully eventually real biomedicine and the
 last example of that that I want to show you is about really reprogramming that hardware and so
 so this is the planarian so these are those flat worms that that I told you about and these guys
 have some amazing properties they are resistant to injury because they're highly regenerative
 every piece will regrow into a perfect worm they are at least this asexual strain is immortal they
 do not seem to age they are completely resistant to any kind of transgenesis so so no one has a
 transgenic mutant kind of planaria unlike other species of which of course you can get many
 mutants and that's because this species more than any other that I'm aware of is assuming that the
 DNA is unreliable and has remarkable algorithms to build the right structure even if the the
 hardware is is modified it has a very chaotic genome and the the one way you can modify it is
 by changing the representation of what these tissues think a correct planarian should look
 like and I'm using all those all those words on purpose so here's here's here's how this works
 uh here's a planarian you cut off the head and the tail by the way this animal here's what the
 normal molecular biology looks like head markers in the head not in the tail very reliably it gives
 a one-headed worm now we discovered now you can ask the question how does this middle piece know
 how many heads it's supposed to have it's not as simple as a positional information gradient
 because these cells to the left of the cut line and the cells to the right of the cut line
 are in the same position along the animal but they have radically different anatomical fates
 this will make a tail that will make a head so how do they know so it turns out there's an
 electrical circuit that stores a pattern that tells them how many heads to have this is this is
 the pattern so this is the voltage pattern one head one tail what we can do is we can rewrite
 that voltage pattern it's kind of a mess because the technology is still being worked out but you
 can what you can do is you can say no actually two heads and if you do that and then you cut
 this animal this is what you get again not photoshop these are real animals now what's
 important is that this voltage map is not a map of this two-headed creature this voltage map is
 a map of this perfectly normal-looking one-headed anatomically normal molecular biologically normal
 creature what you can do is you can revise the stored set point the memory of the collective
 intelligence of these cells as to what you what it's going to do in the future if it gets injured
 until it gets injured nothing happens it sits here normal once you've injured it then it consults
 the pattern and then that is what it builds so this is actually a really primitive counterfactual
 memory i think it might be an early version of that amazing time travel that we have in our brains
 where we can remember things and imagine things that are not true right now this is a simple
 version of that in the collective intelligence of these cells it is a now we can actually see it now
 right we can actually see how does it know how many heads to build this this is how there's a
 there's a there's a permanent stable bioelectrical state that tells it what it's going to do now
 what's the reason i keep calling it a memory is because if you then go ahead and recut these two
 headed worms you will find that they continuously regenerate two-headed with no further manipulation
 nothing has been done to their genome the there this is there's no genomic editing there's nothing
 wrong with their genetics the hardware is completely a wild type but the pattern the
 memory of of what they should be building has been permanently altered and now they're going
 to continue to do this and we can set them back so here's you can see a little video here's what
 these uh you know two brains and one body lots of lots of interesting uh you know neuroscience to be
 done there as well and so we are we're doing we're doing a lot of computational work trying to
 understand how the biophysical properties of the electric circuit map onto some of these amazing
 properties of of memory of pattern completion of and so on not just the number of heads but actually
 you can you can cause them to grow heads for different species so this triangular headed
 species can be made to grow flat heads like a peafelina round heads like an s mediterranean
 this the the shape of their brains and the distribution of their stem cells become just
 like these other species between 100 and 150 million years distance between these guys and them
 and what's happening here is that in anatomical space you can get that same hardware to visit
 different attractors in anatomical space where these other species normally hang out but it's
 perfectly happy to go there if that's what the the bioelectric pattern memory sets it is highly
 reprogrammable and it holds as i showed you in the two the two headed worms now now let's let's
 just take a look at the uh the the limits of that of that plasticity not only can we push them to
 make shapes of other species but we can we can get them to make shapes that planaria don't normally
 make at all so you can ask them to uh you know sort of larger distances in this latent morpheus space
 you can get these spiky things cylindrical kind of combination forms the cells are perfectly
 willing willing to build now interestingly we are not the only bioengineers that humans are not the
 only bioengineers that that try to hack these competencies um here's one of my favorite examples
 so uh acorns make leaves that look like this and you might think that that is what the oak genome
 knows how to do it knows how to make these these leaves but in fact there's another bioengineer
 which is this wasp and what they do is that they use chemical signals to prompt these cells uh to
 build something completely different so these are galls these structures are made of the plant cell
 they're not made of the wasp cells and the wasp is not genetically engineering them what it's doing
 is hacking the normal morphogenetic competencies of these leaf cells to build something completely
 different now if you hadn't seen this would you ever have any idea that these things which
 extremely reliably make flat green structures of a particular shape could ever make this spiky red
 and orange kind of crazy thing so the question is you know what are what are the what are the
 competencies of any given biological hardware and what what can it actually do and so for the last
 for the last few minutes um i want to talk about this idea that um because of this this architecture
 you don't just get emergent complexity you get emergent cognition and so we're going to talk
 about cancer for a couple minutes and then we're going to talk about some synthetic life forms
 so the the the one thing that that happens here in in both both developmentally and evolutionarily
 is that little tiny homeostatic loops for example ph regulation uh can scale up through through
 policies that we can talk about into uh large systems that have very large goals right so this
 is this um like being being connected these these homeostats become connected in networks
 and they're able to represent larger and larger goal states so this is this is what's happening
 well while these single cell creatures are very tiny cognitive light cones they're only uh following
 um trying to implement uh goals that are about the size of a single cell the rest of it's just
 environment evolution and development uh gives them some some some great properties that allow
 them to now pursue very grandiose large scale goals like this like stay in this region of
 anatomical morpheus space if you're deviated come back to it so these are very large so so no
 individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have but the collective
 absolutely does because if you try to deviate it away it will uh it will come back and then stop
 when it's done but that um that uh that ability to scale your cognitive light cone to to connect
 into electrical networks that represent larger and larger goal states has a failure mode that
 failure mode is cancer so when the electrical connections are broken what you see here is a
 reversion to unicellular ancient behavior this is human glioblastoma these these cells have
 disconnected electrically from uh from each other and from normal tissue as far as they're concerned
 the rest of the body is just external environment and they've rolled back to their tiny little
 ancient goals of of uh you know metabolic physiological and proliferative kinds of states
 so that view of of cancer as a kind of dissociative identity disorder of the collective
 intelligence of the body uh makes a very specific prediction it says that cancer is not more selfish
 it just has smaller selves that what's happened here is that the boundary between self and world
 has shrunk and so the idea here um why why this is important is that that the size of the mind of the
 collective agent you know what are the goals that it can that it can pursue are not fixed and at
 least in biology they're not fixed they can they can grow and shrink even within the animal's
 lifetime or the you know the creature's lifetime and so what you can see is using this bioelectrical
 imaging you can see that okay the here's here's where we injected the human oncogene it's going
 to have a tumor even before the tumor appears you can you can see where that's going to happen
 and now we get to find out whether this crazy way of looking at the biology you know really looking
 at cancer not as a genetic disorder or you know a mutation and hardware that needs to be killed by
 toxic chemotherapy but but literally by a dissociative kind of condition that leads to
 a prediction that actually once you do this once you inject these oncogenes you don't have to kill
 the cells what if we just forcibly reconnect them to the rest of the body because the first thing
 that that transform cells do is is electrically decouple from their neighbors and become amoebas
 basically so when you do this and so we've done this in the frog system now we're moving into
 humans um human the human cells and and eventually human patients what happens is that this is the
 same animal even though the oncoprotein is blazingly expressed it's all over the place
 there is no tumor and that's because it's not the genetics that drives it's the physiology
 it's once these cells are electrically coupled to their neighbors it's the collective that works on
 building good organs good skin whatever muscle whatever it's going to build instead of this
 individualized behavior as the boundary between self and world shrinks so that's the thing about
 biological hardware is that it has this amazing multi-scale competency architecture where the
 parts can rebel because that boundary between self and world is so dynamic it it it gives it gives us
 our plasticity the ability to handle novel circumstances problem solving in ways you've
 never seen before but it also means that your parts are at at the they run the risk of rebelling
 which is typically not something we see in in you know in today's robotic architectures for example
 they're kind of have have have a much more much more flat so so okay so so what we see is that
 this architecture architecture can set the size of goals and now we can ask at the very end we
 can ask where do these goals come from what what what sets the goals so i'll show you this this
 little creature so so here it is running around and i might ask you what this is and you might
 guess that this is something i got off the bottom of a pond somewhere some sort of primitive organism
 if you were to sequence the genome here what you would see is homo sapiens 100 homo sapiens no no
 change this is a this is these are cells taken from a from an adult in fact elderly human patient
 their tracheal epithelial cells in a new environment they can reboot their multicellularity
 and they can make something completely different that does not look like their adult form nor does
 it look look like any stage of human embryonic development we call them anthrobots they have all
 kinds of interesting capabilities they are self motile they swim around with these little cilia
 really interesting many interesting properties i'll just show you one one thing they know how
 to do is if you grow some human neurons in a dish and put a big scratch through it like a wound like
 this these spots will sit down there's a super bot cluster there's a bunch of them sitting here
 and what they'll do right here if you lift them lift them up four days later you see that what
 they've done is taken the edges of the neural wound and and and healed them together and sewn
 them together now who would have known that your tracheal cells which sit quietly in your airway for
 decades have the ability to self-assemble into a motile little uh little proto-organism with it with
 a different uh set of behaviors with a very different transcriptome actually and has these
 these these weird competencies there are others this is uh are these are our xenobots so these
 are made of frog skin cells no neurons just frog skin cells and one of the many things they can do
 is uh take loose skin cells that you provide them with and collect them into little little balls
 both both collectively and individually they they they push them together into these little balls
 which then mature and become the next generation of xenobots and guess what they do they run around
 and collect more and do the same thing this is a kind we call this kinematic replication it's uh
 sort of a simplified version of what von neumann wanted which is a robot that makes copies of
 itself from stuff it finds in the environment and so all of these competencies these these different
 things they do we really need to understand where these things come from because what they where
 they don't come from is eons of evolutionary selection there's never been any xenobots there's
 never been any anthropobots there's never been direct selection for the kinds of things that
 they're doing these are consequences of the of the material of the competencies of the material
 that are able through all the different examples that i've showed you are able to
 reconfigure themselves into functional beings in novel environments and and that that degree
 of plasticity gives us phenotypes that we could not have predicted at the beginning we do not
 have a science that would have looked at the genome for sure or even at the cellular properties
 and told us that something like this was going to happen but actually the reality is that you don't
 have to go far to find unexpected problem solving it does not take complex biology so this is a
 pre-print on the paper is is in the revision right now even something as simple as a classic sorting
 algorithm we're talking bubble sort selection sort things like that with if you if you look at it the
 right way if you if you watch how it navigates sorting space you can find some very interesting
 properties and i don't have time it looks like i'm running out of time here but it has very
 interesting properties that are not directly in the algorithm the it has it has some some problem
 solving capabilities that are not at all obvious from the from the algorithm and apparently nobody
 has has noticed that despite the decades of work with these algorithms so my point is like don't
 worry about the time the next session will be your panel and so if you need more time to present the
 subject matter it'll be taken up in the panel don't worry about okay cool yeah i'm almost done
 anyway just a couple of things yeah so i mean the lesson the lesson that um i think we learned from
 this is is a few things first of all uh in biology you know when when we see these when we see these
 complex uh kinds of biological systems you know even cells are incredibly complex when we see them
 doing new things we didn't expect the uh temptation is to say well there's a there's a mechanism for
 it somewhere you know we we just haven't we just haven't discovered all the mechanisms who knows
 what the selection forces were really uh there's got to be a mechanism for it but um in in extremely
 minimal systems so there are people working in minimal active matter so droplets and things
 like that and then here which is even more minimal which is six lines of code you know in these
 sorting algorithms fully deterministic nowhere to hide no new mechanisms even there you see
 unexpected not just complexity not just unpredictable features but unexpected problem
 solving in specific spaces so my claim is that um what we really need and this is what the field
 of diverse intelligence aims at is to uh really uh have a lot of humility about uh what what the parts
 can do um in in terms of uh novel novel problem solving competencies and and and we should get
 better at noticing those we should get better at understanding what space they're working in
 you know and things like even something is something as simple as a uh as a distributed
 sorting algorithm can do uh delayed gratification of the kind that uh that uh James talked about
 you know they can temporarily unsort the string to uh to get to have gains later when you start
 breaking numbers that refuse to move and things like that you know you you confronted with
 challenges you know the typical sorting algorithm never asks if i say swap two numbers it never asks
 did you really get swapped or did the hardware fail and as long as you don't let the hardware
 fail you don't see any of these things when you see it is is precisely when you're trying this with
 unreliable hardware and then you see how it handles these problems and i think biology is all about
 figuring out uh new ways to uh to solve problems because the hardware is known to be uh unreliable
 at every scale from from the beginning so because of this uh because the biology is so um
 fundamentally uh committed to plasticity and to not taking too seriously the meaning of past
 information whether those be memories or uh genetic you know genomic uh information and so on uh it is
 also incredibly interoperable so almost any combination of living material um engineered
 material like like nanomaterials and electrodes and things like that and software is going to be some
 kind of agent and many of these already exist i mean there are already uh people that are for all
 intents and purposes cyborgs um there are there are hybrids there are many different kinds of
 ways to combine living material and non-living material which which which is critical because
 a couple of things this this this points out a couple things first of all that old categories of
 you know this is a real organism and this is a mere machine that doesn't work anymore i mean it
 never really worked but but for sure it's not going to work in the future because any combination of
 these things is viable and whatever theory you have about what uh organisms can do and what machines
 can do has to be able to handle all of the in-between cases it is not just about evolution it
 is not just about uh creatures that are on the tree of life somewhere with us such that we can
 sort of know how to treat them because um because uh we you know we know we know what they're made
 of and how they got here those kind of categories are not going to work anymore so this is what this
 is the kind of thing you have to have in mind when we talk about the capabilities of living things
 and of novel constructs it is you know basically it is it is it is no longer uh feasible to just
 think about the the set of uh evolved natural natural creatures that we have on earth versus
 these kind of architectures now we didn't that we make now it is true that that as i've pointed out
 there are many aspects of biology that are very different from the way we engineer today
 so um the way we the way that we make our hardware extremely reliable the way we isolate the layers
 from each other the flatness of our architectures the the commitment to fidelity of information
 storage as opposed to constant reinterpretation you know the fact that we see confabulation the
 the creative interpretation uh as as a as a bug instead of a feature biology uses uses extensively
 as a feature all of those things are are quite different but there is no reason i think that we
 couldn't learn the lessons of what the biology is trying to teach us and make similar systems or
 in fact hybrid systems and that is what i think the next few decades are going to be all about
 it is also critical that um the old standby for for for ethical decisions you know it used to be
 that confronted with something you can sort of knock on it and if you hear a clanging metallic
 sound you can conclude that okay this came from a factory it's going to be boring and predictable
 and most of all i am ethically justified in you know refactoring it into a vacuum cleaner i could
 do whatever i want with it but if you but if you had kind of like a like a soft um you know sort
 of wooly kind of uh kind of response then you say ah this is a natural creature and i need to be nice
 to it and and so on so those those kinds of uh reliance on on what you look like and and where
 you came from is really not going to be feasible at all even if even in the absence of actual
 aliens but just all of the things that um we are going to be living with all of these um novel um
 novel bodies and novel minds which means that we have we need better categories better ethical
 categories of how we are going to relate to creatures that are nowhere on the tree of life
 with us so um this is the summary of of what i try to uh say today that i think that intelligence
 in the sense of problem solving i didn't say anything about consciousness but but in the sense
 of uh third person observable problem solving uh in different spaces which are not obvious for us
 to recognize is ubiquitous especially in biology it is everywhere and we should be very suspicious
 of claims that something is not intelligent because i think um you know the the identification of
 intelligence is is a difficult task and i think uh it says as much about the observer making that
 claim as it does about the system itself whatever limitations they think there are um we really i
 i think it's really essential not only for biomedical progress because learning to communicate
 with the cellular collective intelligence has enabled some really important advances
 but also uh the ethical flourishing of of beings is going to require us to learn to uh identify
 intelligence in places where where we're just not familiar with it i i think it's really important
 to to to have some humility about about the fact that we do not know what something can do what
 it wants what kind of goals it has what are the scope of its goals uh just because we know the
 algorithm we know the material it's made of or even because we made it ourselves i think there's
 a lot of this is emergent in a very strong in a very strong sense and not just emerging complexity
 but emergent problem-solving competencies and emergent goals which is which is really you know
 what makes this a an existential level problem for humanity going forward there's a research
 agenda here which which many people in a diverse intelligence community are following and i kind
 of encourage anybody interested in ai and these these bigger questions to familiarize themselves
 with with the work of the di community uh we are looking for principled frameworks that um avoid
 the typical teleophobia this this idea that if something is you know made of well recognized
 materials then it doesn't have real goals it has some kind of derived goals from humans or something
 uh but but this idea that um we can't just uh just assume that these that the the these unconventional
 minds don't exist nor nor are we able to daydream that every rock has a has a spirit hidden in it
 we really need to continue this um empirical testing of hypotheses about goal seeking and
 navigational competencies for diverse systems so this is a very practical research agenda this
 is not not philosophy and i think the future really um the kinds of uh conceptual architectural
 approaches that are going to enable all of this to happen are a continuum of mind so not not binary
 categories of of natural kinds which we now know developmentally evolutionarily and via bioengineering
 are not crisp categories and observer relative models that understand that that any kind of
 cognitive claim that we make about systems is basically uh just a uh it's a it's a it's an
 engineering protocol claim it's a it's a statement about how you think you can best interact with
 that system and multiple um observers will see different things and then we can find out who's
 got the who's got the best approach and we are working on the use of ai tools as actually a kind
 of universal translator to some of these diverse intelligences to help us communicate with them so
 um okay i'm done if anybody's interested here are some uh some papers that go into all of this
 in detail and uh i want to thank all the people so these are all the the students and the postdocs
 who did some of the work that i showed you today lots of technical support staff with some some
 wonderful collaborators uh funders all sorts of uh all sorts of people have supported us again
 disclosures there are three companies that have supported some of this work and most of all i
 always thank the animal model systems because they're they're the ones who do all the heavy
 lifting so thank you um i'll take questions that was fabulous um i'm lucky enough to be in the
 privileged position of the moderator who can ask the first question and uh i think you've shown
 compellingly a kind of continuity among functions in in in living and also you spread it all the way
 to not yet living organisms or parts of but the real question then or at least the fundamental
 question that makes it an issue of cognition and not weasel words like intelligence uh
 problem solving those are things that it's easy to believe that even the um the primitive notion
 of a machine which is a metal gadget you can easily see how those things can become mechanisms
 that solve problems that that um that uh that do it and that we're ready to call intelligent
 but the real borderline and this is where i'm afraid of your answer because everything so far
 has been intellectually and scientifically solid but now i'm gonna and you said you're not doing
 philosophy absolutely you're not doing philosophy you're doing biological science but now we go
 into a question which is also not philosophical but it's only philosophers that ever really
 give it serious thought that little creature you showed with the long nose that could do all these
 etc what's that called it's a lacrimaria okay according to mike levin is that lacrimarian
 sentient or not what what is the definition that you're using what it what doesn't feel
 it can feel it feels like something to be that creature it doesn't feel like anything to be my
 iphone well yeah i mean so okay so so yeah so absolutely i think the lacrimaria can feel if
 that's if that's uh yeah i mean all of those words need definitions too and here we get into like we
 can have a really tricky discussion but i think i think i understand what you're asking and i think
 there's no question the lacrimaria is if it's that description do you think the brain is an or if we
 had to localize feeling in an organism i assume you don't think that every every bit of an organism
 feels would you agree that it's neural tissue that is the organ of this capacity and not
 just so the so the somatic entity or do you uh well a couple of things so so first of all i
 don't believe any of these questions have binary answers so i don't think we can ask does it or
 doesn't it i think it's a continuum and i think we have to say how much and what kind but i also i
 mean look uh if if we try to say let's let's try to make a list of all the reasons why we believe
 that brain tissue is the seat of whatever you know term you want i i think we can make a pretty good
 case that lots of other tissues in the body meet that criterion and i i do actually think that there
 are other things that are absolutely not brains including in our bodies that have very sort of
 primitive basal uh cognitive experiences in other spaces yeah i do i do believe that and who's
 feeling that am i feeling that if i have some in my stomach you you i mean right so so when you say
 you so right now your left hemisphere and my left hemisphere are having a lovely chat but there are
 other components in your body that do not have uh the the ability to verbalize their their primitive
 basic feelings but for the same reason that our brains can uh can support this yeah i absolutely
 think that there are other organs in your body that have it they just can't talk about it
 and i don't so i'm like a split brain i don't know about these other feeling creatures in my body
 certainly and you don't know about mine either right so so you know we give each other the
 benefit of the doubt but but you you cannot directly feel my inner perspective and neither
 can you feel the direct neither can your left hemisphere which is who i'm talking to right now
 can feel the others in the body absolutely i've used used up my prerogative now that's i know more
 from me it's open to you and please take advantage of it he's absolutely remarkable uh do you have
 are you are you good at multitasking do can you look up your your um i could read them out but
 can you look up the the uh spectator's comments because is is this on the q a window yeah it's on
 the q a window and i can ask julia to give hers a lot in words as the first one julia do you want
 to voice your comment sure um thanks for the talk great um i was wondering do you see a connection
 between um the evolution of electrical circuits for storing information within organisms which
 was something you um touched on in one of your slides and one of the proposed triggers for the
 development of human language which which is displacement um because they both seem to me to
 be um related to trying to time travel yeah i mean so so okay i i do not have any evidence that uh
 these other systems that we work on organs tissues whatever that they have uh anything like human
 language so we've not seen any evidence of that and so i'm not claiming that however um i think
 if i understand when you say displacement you mean temporally right is that what you mean yeah like
 the ability to call up and refer to something that's not physically present yep um i i think i think
 we've seen primitive versions of that i don't think i we've seen anything like what uh you know what
 humans are able to do with it but uh we have yes the the need i mean even even unicellular organisms
 can predict the future they have a little bit of an anticipation horizon that you know that's been
 shown and uh being able to answer what am i going to do if a specific thing happens is is something
 that we see um these systems doing in anatomical space so you know if you if you were to take that
 to its logical conclusion would you develop some kind of language that works in anatomical space
 maybe i don't think it's impossible but we don't we don't have evidence for that right now
 okay can you see your can you see the comments there just in case i'm going to do another call
 if you have a question or a comment either panelist or attendee raise the hand or or
 type it into the comments there are two anonymous ones that you might want to bundle you've already
 done julian okay uh let's see uh striking similarities between your theories and henry lebois um
 i i i'm i don't i don't know um i have to think it's it's it's hard to say which of these things
 are uh necessity and which are coincidence but i really do think that that that um
 that that feedback loop that ratchet that starts with the idea that your your substrate is
 unreliable and therefore the surviving uh this is this is the adaptive strategy is is to be able to
 uh have to solve problems on the fly i think that is what fundamentally kickstarts this this uh this
 the spiral that that that we're so you know so advanced at it it um you know uh right from the
 beginning the need to deal with with with novelty and uh perturbation and and to keep uh keep track
 of a of a certain path in physiological space and anatomical space and eventually to keep a coherent
 linguistic story which a lot of my understanding is a lot of lms have a problem with this is to
 keep keep a narrative going you know for long periods of time i i trace that all the way back
 to the beginning of of life so i i tend to think this is really a foundational um force uh if you
 want to call it that already laboree didn't do anything faintly like what you're doing i i think
 i know who asked that question and one could admire ahri laboree but not compare it with this
 this is genuine biology and it and it and it delivers what it's saying um
 i don't know it's it's odd i mean everybody's
 gobsmacked by your talk but it seems to it seems to have uh silenced them i i mean i can read a
 couple of the others i see i see some of the other q and a's go ahead go ahead let's see are the
 findings reconcilable with reductionism well um so so so i think reductionism is a frame that one
 takes when dealing with with um with these systems and i i definitely think it's it's a very limiting
 frame because the thing the thing that i think reductionism is is is really good at is looking
 backwards so if um if uh if if i give you a system or an experimental result uh then you can always
 tell a molecular level story about what just happened so explaining backwards you can always
 say well look i can see this the you know this molecule bound to that molecule you know no no
 no surprise but i think uh what what science and life in particular are all about is going
 forwards the question is does that framing help you do the next interesting thing does it help you
 get the next uh new capability new discovery and in some cases of the reductionist approach works
 in the vast majority of cases that we're interested in i absolutely do not think it works
 and i think that there are really fundamental um control knobs and fundamental phenomena that
 are by the if you do try to reduce them to their components you miss everything that's interesting
 about what you're trying to do so i think i think it is a frame that is useful in some cases but
 certainly not um not universal uh let's see have i tried doing this with externally composed magnetic
 fields so unfortunately magnetic fields are not a great way to manipulate um electrical potentials
 in in resting like you can trigger neuronal firing and so on but they're not good for uh for for
 setting up these kinds of things so unfortunately magnets don't work i should also say that you know
 bioelectricity isn't magical in the sense that it's not the only thing that can underlie this
 kind of cognitive scaling of like it is one great example which is why i talk about it of how
 individual cell competencies become um large scale anatomical competencies but there are other kinds
 of cognitive glue uh that function at the molecular level to make cells and no doubt somewhere else in
 the universe there are other mechanisms that do it so um you know bioelectricity is important
 for us that has a good example but i don't think it's the only way to do it um let's see uh okay
 could i say more about ai as a tool for shedding light on some of these topics well um a couple of
 things uh we so so so in our lab we kind of have this hopefully this loop going where we use ai to
 try to help us understand the patterns that we're seeing but then we also would like to take some of
 the things that we're learning and make more resilient uh you know really bio like truly bio
 inspired ai's that i think would have very different properties from from what has been
 from what has been made so far and in particular uh you know using it as a kind of minimally biased
 i don't want to say unbiased but like minimally biased way to detect intelligence we need we need
 tools we need um uh appliances and tools and uh those kinds of things to recognize these
 these sorts of beings around us we are not good at it and you know you need you need some impedance
 match between what you're trying to find and what you have and so i think physics only sees
 machinery and not mine because it uses you know voltmeters and rulers and low agency tools and so
 mines are good at seeing other minds but but we have a lot of very limited limiting firmware that
 we've sort of inherited in our evolutionary history and i would like to see if ai can help us
 notice these kinds of properties and so and so we're using tools to try to analyze other
 systems whether they be purely simulations or actual real biological data to say to to generate
 hypotheses to say look if you hypothesize this problem space then you could hypothesize this is
 the goal and look now you gain extra explanatory power and now here's new control knobs that you
 can use and so i i think we need we need we need tools to to help us um let's see uh how did you
 learn which voltage to trigger to make a morphology develop okay yeah the spiky shape right so so there
 are two kinds of experiments that i showed you most of them came from observing natural uh
 bioelectrical states their um anatomical outcomes and basically trying to work out the mapping so
 we call this cracking the bioelectric code so most of them are like that the spiky thing was not like
 that the spiky thing i have no idea like we we guessed that and it's basically uh us trying to
 probe the edges of this latent space we have no idea you know in this in cracking this code we
 only know a few words in that code really i think this is just the beginning of a massive project
 and uh this we could not have predicted that the spiky thing was going to form the other
 things were predicted the spiky format let's see uh uh stefan should i keep going or yes please
 uh we'll we'll we'll cut it off at three o'clock and give you a little a little after three give
 you a rest because you're going to be it's going to go on afterwards i've been copying them down
 too so we can import them into the panel cool okay oh yep i can do a few more let's see anything
 common to the dynamics of the community of signal and cell networks and the dynamics of functional
 brain signals yeah great great question um yes in fact uh you know um a girl so well who's a
 collaborator of ours in at ucsd has been recording signals from bacterial biofilms and and there are
 papers you know on on brain-like activity in biofilms where what's happening is that
 the the individual bacteria are using electrical signals to coordinate feeding across the whole so
 that everybody in the uh everybody in the in the um in the colony gets to eat so again this kind
 of like cognitive glue thing they actually use potassium spikes as a timing as a timing signal
 so so same thing with us we are we are we are currently using analyses of these bioelectrical
 signals uh that are very similar to what people do in analyzing brain function so
 calculations of um uh integrated information and and all of these other things so you know i'm not
 prepared yet to say which are very similar and which are you know which are which are which are
 usefully similar that that that is still in progress but um i think that but but we think
 there's enough there that that we're putting a lot of effort into it um let's see uh we show
 that the flatworms anatomy is controlled by the electrical signal across this body and you can
 alter the anatomy during regrowth how does the signal arise in the first place yeah uh right so
 so that's a that's a great question uh we can we can watch uh the planarian is a funny case because
 planaria are come from other planaria but but if you want to go to the to the origin we can talk
 about the frog um the frog embryo uh patterns so the frog embryo patterns we can watch from the
 fertile from the unfertilized oocyte here comes the sperm it gets fertilized and we watch the
 pattern um get you know become more and more complex the question of where does it come from
 uh is is a tricky uh it is a bit of a philosophical question i mean it's definitely not
 directly encoded in the genome because the genome doesn't say anything about patterns
 the electrical or otherwise the genome encodes uh ion channel properties now uh in a certain sense
 the it it certainly does the genome certainly does contribute to the outcome because by uh
 constraining the specific electrical hardware you get to um uh constrain the space of possible
 dynamics so in fact you it's it's more it's more than that you you end up making hardware that
 reliably by default when the when the power comes on and metabolism cranks up by by default it
 settles into a particular pattern but what we see is that is that those circuits are also
 reprogrammable because if you change because you can change the pattern in all kinds of interesting
 ways and then it can store it and then it can change it in other ways and so on so where does
 it come from i mean look uh we imagine imagine a galton board right so so it's a it's a it's
 a board it's got a bunch of nails banged into it and you take a bucket of marbles and you sort of
 dump it in the marbles go boom boom boom and then they land at the bottom every time you do this
 they make it they make a beautiful bell curve shape so you could ask where does the shape where
 is that shape encoded you're not going to find it in the wood you're not going to find it in the
 nails where is the shape encoded so i think i think there are a couple of components here i think
 asking where something is encoded sometimes is the right answer for example in asking for any given
 planarian where is the current target morphology encoded we know where it's in the distribution
 of the of the voltage gradients but also there is a sense in which it comes from wherever the laws
 of mathematics come from because by establishing specific types of ion channels you immediately
 get to use a bunch of what physicists might call free lunches which is the fact that if you have
 a voltage gated ion channel what you have is a voltage gated current conductance you have a
 transistor you have a couple of transistors you can make a logic gate when you have a logic gate
 you immediately get all of the things that come with it all of the laws of computation the fact
 that mand is special like all of these things you didn't have to evolve any of them they all come for
 free so to speak and so so part of these patterns come because evolution has shaped the hardware
 and part of these patterns come because that hardware exploits the free gifts of the laws
 of computation the laws of physics the laws of geometry and many other things it's a it's a it's
 a really tricky question and and but the implications of it are actually are interesting
 it's that you know we what we're doing and i think i think what what these these xenobots
 and anthropobots that i showed you these these synthetic constructs what i think they really are
 are exploration vehicles for exploring the latent space or the platonic space
 which evolution is is is is is so good at searching i think what evolution is doing is
 searching for hardware that dips into this space of possibilities and and and and exploits these
 different free affordances that are there and i think what we're doing is is putting a little
 periscope into that space and searching the the area around that one point that a standard embryo
 gives you and tries to see what's um what's there uh let's see uh would this framework say the name
 out loud so i can keep track for what what's left for you after sure um the next one says anonymous
 uh anonymous attendee it says would this framework the one before let's that won't help oh sorry
 yeah yeah just before it andrew holliday the one before that was andrew holliday okay thanks
 right okay so the next one's anonymous is would this framework include human society so but
 potentially but but i think it's really important to to know that these kind of questions i mean
 people say okay then then you know our ecosystems all of earth gaia the universe you know the galaxy
 are they also cognitive i i the the important thing there is that these are empirical questions we
 cannot just have philosophical feelings about and by the way i have nothing against philosophy a lot
 of what i do i think is actually partly philosophy but but but i like philosophy that's really
 grounded and that has um practical implications and so i think before we say anything about these
 other larger systems we have to do experiments um you know is it possible that some of these
 social systems financial systems i mean so i have a i have a collaborator that's actually testing
 this idea that the financial markets can be you know trained and that uh and and things like that
 we have to do experiments and the larger the system the harder it is to do some of these
 experiments but we can't say yes or no until somebody's actually done the experiments um
 yeah i think i think that's definitely an empirical question um let's see uh okay next is
 also anonymous it says in cognitive neuroscience the atoms of the current crop of normative models
 are perceptrons and learnable synapses in your field what would be the atoms of normative models
 uh well two two things so so at one level the level that i talked about today uh it would be
 the um the gap junction which are basically uh it's it's it's basically an ancient electrical
 synapse that connects two cells directly and i can tell you a whole story about why these gap
 junctions are an amazing kind of cognitive glue but at a lower level what i didn't even talk
 about at all is that you actually don't need cells to see some of these properties some uh just
 signaling pathways so imagine you know i don't know five to ten uh molecules or genes that turn
 each other on and off in the network that alone can give rise to six different kinds of learning
 including pavlovian conditioning so it's really not tied to to bioelectricity per se it's tied
 to some some basic properties of uh of of um uh components that i think arise very readily in at
 least in in our world they arise very readily and very early uh in what people think about the tree
 of life i think pre you know i think this stuff predates life actually as um as people define it
 uh okay let's see okay the last one all right let's okay one more uh that was perhaps more
 informative i could process uh sorry uh the story of cancer cells that suffer from a kind of
 communication disorder and develop a mini self as a result made me think about what role communication
 in all those different spaces has yeah if i make other entities to communicate might they unify uh
 yeah yeah i think i think communication is is key um specific i mean we've been studying different
 properties of the communication policies so there are different policies that do or do not um
 facilitate the formation of these uh kind of larger scale collectives out of pieces it's not
 guaranteed so you know simply simply having a bunch of pieces connected to each other doesn't
 doesn't do it we need to understand more about these policies but yeah i think i think actually
 communication is is critical you want to knock it off and take a rest or do you want to let's let's
 let's take let's take a rest and and i'll you know and we'll come back what is it in a half an hour
 okay do me a favor before we turn this off you should also uh copy into it into a text file
 the ones that are left from the next question so that you have them to look at okay uh i will
 just just copy paste them into a text file yep okay uh let's see is there is there any way is
 is there an easy way to save them or or i gotta just mouse it into a no there is never mind i
 have it but then it'll it'll force me to read it but that's fine if you can i can do it but
 it'll take me you know some number of minutes to uh to do it there's a there's a bunch more
 trouble with that is that i want to save this video and for that we have to turn the whole thing off
 got it uh okay i'm i'm on it uh i'm uh here let me let me do it
 yeah boy there's some there's some great questions uh i'm just
 no no no you go ahead i was talking to i don't want to cut it off until you're done
 all right i'm yeah i'm copying and pasting as fast as i can here
 oh boy you can scroll down the whole thing and then get it all in one piece instead of oh oh i
 see you're right you can you can actually oh geez i didn't realize you could get them all thank you
 um yeah okay one second okay um okay got him okay thank you cool all right thanks
