 A causality problem, precisely.
 And then, the point where the hard problem, sorry, yes, the hard problem that is attached to this problem of causality is when we ask ourselves the question,
 what is the causality status of the feeling, the fact that when I look at Mary, it's not just the optical treatment that is done.
 If I was like a normal robot, if I had sensors that when the photons came out of Mary and hit the surface of my photodetector,
 there was something that was recorded, and then it can appear right away, and at the end I can say, "Ah, that's Mary." And all that, to learn how to say that, etc.
 There is no problem there. The problem comes when it looks like something to see Mary.
 I remind you that the feeling is the feeling in whatever modality. We have the tendency to conceive that as an emotion, pain.
 It's the feeling when I see, instead of treating optically, when I see, when I hear, instead of treating acoustically, and when I'm touching something.
 So, that's the feeling. And then the reason why the feeling is difficult to explain is contrary to the action.
 There are two reasons why it's difficult. One of the reasons, and the main reason, is that everything that happens and everything that can be observed
 has already been explained with the solution of the easy problem. So there is no question to be raised to the exception of the feeling, I will come back.
 But apart from that, there is no causal question that you ask in the universe when the easy problem is solved.
 All these questions, we have already answered. There is no uncertainty for causality in terms of actions.
 So when we say, "Okay, but you started the course with maps, and with maps we noticed that there is more than that.
 I am not quite simply a being that acts. I feel." What is that? What is the role in this causal economy?
 What is the causal role of the feeling? And that's why we turn immediately to the liberator.
 Because if we think a little bit, if the feeling was just a kind of decoration, it would always be a problem, but it would be another problem.
 If it was just that it's not that I feel like I'm posing things, but simply that when things happen, it looks like something.
 So I have a kind of... There is a decoration, it's like a garnish. It would remain a problem.
 But here it would be a little bit more similar to what philosophers call an epiphenomenon.
 That is to say, something that is there, but which has no causal role.
 So it's still... it's embarrassing, and it's sure that there is something that remains to be explained, but it's more than that.
 Because the impression that we have is that not only do I have the feeling, but it counts for something.
 And it's not for nothing that when we talk about pain, when we ask someone innocent and na√Øve,
 "What is it that, when we endow the skin and it hurts, why does it hurt?"
 They say, "Well, if it didn't hurt, I wouldn't take it into account." It's obvious, but I repeat.
 Since we have already explained everything that is action, I have already explained that when your skin is endangered,
 there is a whole circle that is at stake, that takes your hand off the fire and makes you learn how to put your hand in the fire.
 And that is explained with the facial problem. The only thing that is not explained is that it looks like something touching a warm surface.
 And moreover, the truth is that I take my hand off before I feel the heat.
 The causality is really embarrassing in this story.
 And the tendency that we have is to answer like, "Is it you?" "No, it's you." Who has to talk about choice?
 He's not here, is he? Okay. He's here.
 Yes, he has nothing to say.
 So, the one who invokes the question of choice, implicitly, he says, "I make the choice. It's me who makes the choice."
 And if Kader insists, he says, "What does it mean to say that it's me who makes the choice?"
 I know that when you play billiards and you give a blow from the stick to a billiard, then it will touch the other.
 So here, I understand the causality. It's the first blow that was transmitted, etc., energy transmission, all that.
 It's the causality. I understand the causality.
 But what is the causality behind your free will? What is it?
 We have already explained why you renounce your right.
 What else is there when you voluntarily decide to renounce your right?
 And then when we talk about the Manipulation of freedom, who wants to restrict it?
 Who knows? Freedom. L-U-B-E-T.
 Nobody?
 Well, there, Etienne says it, or he doesn't say it.
 I'm not saying that this Manipulation is not without its flaws.
 There are flaws in what I was going to describe.
 But it shows how complicated this question of causality is when it comes to our free will is.
 He made a Manipulation. He shows the subject a clock.
 Where does the hand do a turn in 60 seconds? Normally.
 And there, he gives them a button.
 And their task is to press the button when they decide.
 And they are the ones who choose when to press the button.
 And the only thing they ask is that when they... Look at the clock.
 Fix the clock. Look closely.
 And the moment you notice that you are...
 Well, the moment your free will launches the movement.
 I would know when you make the movement because it will be recorded.
 It's not a problem to notice the moment when the button is touched.
 But when you, in your idea, decide to press the button,
 notice where the clock is at that moment.
 And give me a moment.
 So we have the moment when the movement is created.
 We have the moment when the subject says that it is at that moment that I wanted the movement.
 And in addition, we have another measurement, which is what is called in German, the "right shot" potential.
 The potential of preparation.
 What is at the beginning of the EG.
 Well, it's more than the EG, it's the potential of the clock, the average.
 In any case, let's say that there is a curve that starts from zero before a movement.
 It doesn't surprise us that it is a cerebral preparation to make a movement.
 It's not shocking that the brain does that before we see the face, because it's the brain in the space.
 The big question is this third event.
 We know when the button has been pressed.
 We know when the potential of preparation has been triggered.
 And it doesn't surprise us that it triggers before the movement takes place.
 This place, the moment, the subject says that it is at that moment that I wanted the movement.
 And so, it's there.
 I imagine it's before the movement, then after the trigger.
 I say that there are flaws in this experience that have been extremely influential.
 And it's quite compatible with the hard problem.
 That is to say that yes, the easy solution is to ignore what the person says after their feeling.
 You will know when, with the heteroprenomenology, when the curve is triggered,
 you know that it will press a few milliseconds later.
 Already, there, you explained, it's the trigger.
 And when you will have the entire circuit, the motor, you will have explained how he did this movement and what triggered it.
 Pretends, neglects what he says.
 Because what he says is not compatible with data.
 So I tell you that the hard problem would be just as hard if the moment of the trigger of the potential was simultaneous with the moment of wanting the movement.
 It wouldn't have changed anything.
 We would have said, but why do we need two events there?
 It's enough to have the trigger of the motor, and then the action, and then all that, it's an easy problem.
 What's the point? It's all.
 And then, if it was even more complicated than that,
 we could say that the subject did not want the movement before the trigger of the potential.
 Do you prefer that as a solution?
 But then, you have to ask what happened there in the brain.
 Because with good heteroprenomenology,
 we will be able to identify the moment when the brain made the decision to trigger the motor potential.
 So even if the movement felt was above all, there is always a question of causality.
 There is always a redundancy.
 We will have the cerebral process, and we say, well, why is it that the cerebral process does not suffer?
 It's a completely innocent event, and a completely easy problem.
 I did not speak enough, now I need reaction.
 We are at the heart of the difficulty of the hard problem, which is a problem of causality.
 I have no doubt that if we do enough heteroprenomenology,
 it is just to make correlations between what you do, what you say, as Danette said in her paper,
 you will report when you saw the red elephant, etc.
 We will find the air that is active when you see a red elephant in your mind.
 So all the correlations will be there.
 There will not be an event where there is something spiritual that happens and then there is something else.
 That would be really tricky.
 So there will always be correlations there, and there will always be the question,
 okay, if you have the cerebral process, then what is this feeling there?
 But let's put that aside.
 It is a problem of causality that is linked with abolition, the will, and then the choice.
 Because it is still a problem, it is not still a problem.
 To remind you, yes, go ahead.
