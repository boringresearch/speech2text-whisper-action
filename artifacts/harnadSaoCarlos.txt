 [Speaking Spanish]
 My name is Stephen Harnad, and besides congratulating you,
 I would like to also give you some advice on how to fill your repository.
 The first and most important thing is to implement the ePrint request button.
 That's the button that can be used if a paper is deposited in closed access
 and not open access, then the user can press the button
 and can request from the author a single copy which the repository sends out automatically.
 This is the way to resist publisher embargoes on open access.
 You should now adopt a mandatory immediate open deposit policy.
 That means everyone has to deposit their paper immediately upon acceptance for publication.
 They don't have to make it open access right away because of the button,
 but they must deposit it immediately.
 And if they don't deposit it, you should make it a condition
 that only deposits in the repository are eligible for evaluation of performance.
 That will motivate authors to put in their papers.
 And then also to motivate them, you should give them statistics
 on how many downloads there were, how many citations there were.
 You should send them reminders.
 Don't deposit for them.
 And make sure that they deposit their final refereed accepted draft.
 Don't insist that it should be the publisher's PDF.
 And don't make any deals with publishers.
 Don't let them be involved at all.
 Self-archiving of one's own research is between the author and the author's institution.
 The publisher has nothing to do with it.
 And thanks to the e-print request button, you don't have to worry about publisher embargoes.
 I actually encourage you to ignore publisher embargoes,
 but if you're going to take them into consideration at all,
 then use the e-print request button.
 Again, best of luck for Open Access Week and with your repository.
 Bye-bye.
