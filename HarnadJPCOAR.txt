 Hello, my name is Stephen Harnad, and I'm sending greetings from Montreal to the Japanese
 Consortium for Open Access Repositories, JPCOAR.
 Let me add, besides my congratulations, some suggestions.
 Make sure that all of the institutions in Japan have a mandatory, that means required,
 immediate deposit open access policy.
 All authors should be required to deposit their final peer-reviewed, accepted manuscripts
 in the repository immediately upon acceptance.
 They don't have to make an open access right away, if you're worried about publisher
 embargoes, although you shouldn't worry.
 But the repositories should implement the ePrint request button, which means that if
 a article is deposited as closed access and not open access, then users can still request
 by pressing the button and putting in their email addresses a copy for use.
 That way even closed access articles during the embargo will be accessible to everybody.
 And make the deposit into the repository a requirement for performance evaluation.
 It should only be papers in the repository that are eligible to be reviewed for research
 performance evaluation.
 Also provide download statistics and citation statistics to authors in order to give them
 a motivation to deposit and remind them when new papers appear.
 And make sure that they deposit their final referee drafts, not the publisher's PDF.
 And don't make any deals with publishers.
 They have nothing to do with this.
 You don't need publishers in order to provide open access to your institution's research
 output.
 Thank you, and best of luck to JPCoAR.
